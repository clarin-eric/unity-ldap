This repository is no longer used and will be removed in the future. 

This repository was originally based on the unity-idm repository hosted on assembly. After the unity-idm migration to github this repository got out of sync too much and a new fork was created here: https://github.com/clarin-eric/unity. Any new CLARIN unity-idm developments should use this new repository.
