=== Web Admin UI endpoint

Endpoint type:: +WebAdminUI+
Binding:: Web (Vaadin)
Exposed paths:: +/admin+
Default path:: +/admin+

Web Admin UI is the first place to visit after server installation and startup as it offers
a administrator oriented management interface. 
By default it is accessible under the link: +pass:[https://localhost:2443/ENDPOINT-CONFIGURED-CONTEXT/admin]+  
or simply +pass:[https://localhost:2443/ENDPOINT-CONFIGURED-CONTEXT]+ as the +/admin+ path is the default.

The features of the Web Admin interface are covered in the <<contents-management>> section.

Currently the Admin UI endpoint offers the same options as the Home endpoint naturally including the options common 
for all web endpoints. The Home endpoint's options 
can usually be left unchanged as are used only to control the logged user's profile screen, which is also available 
for administrator's convenience in the Admin UI.
