== Translation profiles configuration

Translation profile is a named, ordered list of conditional rules. The rules are used to 
modify the information about a principal being processed by Unity. Such situation occurs when:

. Remote user was externally authenticated and its data is consumed by Unity. In this case
translation is performed by so called _input translation profiles_.
. Information about Unity's entity is being exposed to outside world with an IdP-like endpoint
as SAML web endpoint.  In this case translation is performed by so called _output translation profiles_.

For instance, an input translation profile can change remote attribute 'size' name to
'width' and insert a remotely authenticated user to the local database (to a desired group)
if the user is not yet there. An output profile can return an additional dynamic identity named 'email' 
with a value of an email attribute.   

The following subsections cover both types of translation profiles in details. Though many of the features
are common. The profiles are managed with the Admin UI in the Server management->Translation profiles tab.
The profile has a name and a list of rules. Each rule has a condition and an action.

Conditions are used to dynamically turn action execution on or off. Conditions (as well as some of the arguments 
of translation actions have) have to be specified as _MVEL expressions_. Such expressions allow for a powerful, 
dynamic functionality. 

The full MVEL documentation can be found here: {mveldoc}

The following example condition:
----
attr contains 'cn'
----
will trigger an action whenever the subject has an attribute +cn+. In the following sections there are 
additional examples and a complete reference of all variables which are available to write conditions. Nevertheless
the most popular condition is simply: +true+.

Actions are different for each type of the profile. The editor provides you with helpful interface to create them.

=== Input translation

An input translation profile is always associated with a _remote authenticator in its configuration_.
It is a mandatory setting, all remote authenticators must have one profile associated. This is because it is
typically not possible to provide a sensible default mapping of remote data to the configurable schema used in 
Unity.  

Input translation profile (both conditions and rules) operate on a data structure which is initially
filled by the protocol specific component. The structure can contain:

. Identity (or identities) authenticated by the remote IdP.
. Attributes provided by the remote IdP.
. Groups assigned by the remote IdP.
 
What data is actually in this structure is dependent on the upstream protocol, upstream server and 
callout configuration.

Profile actions map remote data to Unity artifacts. For instance mapped result can be an attribute of type 'cn'
with some dynamic value. The value is completely controllable with a MVEL expression and can be anything from a 
simple direct reuse of remotely provided attribute to a sophisticatedly crafted string. It might be good to 
take a look at the example profile below.

Each profile should be started from a mandatory *identity mapping*. It is possible to control whether
the remote identity should be matched against the local one and/or automatically created. Note that the identity mapping
result decides how the general login process looks like: if a profile maps a user to an existing user (also by 
creating an new entity) login will proceed automatically. If the profile maps the remote user to some not existing 
identity then Unity can be configured to present a registration form or account association dialog. Finally if 
remote user is not mapped to any identity the login fails. 

There are several so called _identity mapping effects_ which are important for the remote user mapping process:

. +CREATE_OR_MATCH+ if the mapped identity doesn't exist it is automatically created. If it exists then the remote user
is mapped onto this entity what sets the context for all other profile actions.   
. +MATCH+ The remote user is mapped onto existing entity it it is found. Otherwise nothing happens. 
. +REQUIRE_MATCH+ The remote user is mapped onto existing entity it it is found. Otherwise authentication is failed.
. +UPDATE_OR_MATCH+ is the most tricky option, similar to +CREATE_OR_MATCH+. 
The remote user is mapped onto an existing one if it exists. Conversely if the resulting identity does not exist 
in the system, then it is created but only if additionally the remote user was already mapped onto existing entity 
by other rules of the profile. This complicated behavior is actually quite useful whenever we want to have new remote
identities propagated to the existing user in Unity, but at the same time we don't want to have a new user (entity) 
created automatically (what would be +CREATE_OR_MATCH+ effect), so that a registration facility can be used.      

Additionally the actions allow for creating Unity's attributes, assigning the remote user to groups and to change
entity status.  

One action requires a special attention: +removeStaleData+. This action, when added to a profile, causes Unity
to remove all stale data: attributes, group memberships, identities. The data is assumed to be stale if it 
was previously created by the same profile, basing on input from the same remote IdP 
and which was not reproduced during the current invocation of the profile.

==== Translation profile creation wizard and dry-run

Unity provides two sophisticated features helping in input translation profile management. First of all it is possible
to use a translation profile creation *wizard*.

The wizard can be activated from the Server management->Translation profiles view. Currently the wizard can be used
to create a profile basing on an available remote authenticator, so you need to configure it first in a regular way.
However any (even empty) translation profile can be initially set for this authenticator.   

After launching the wizard a popup window appears allowing you to select any of the remote authenticators available
in the system (regardless of their assignment to endpoints). The authentication is performed in a sandbox environment
so it is not influencing the running system. After finishing the remote authentication the popup window disappears
and a visual translation profile editor is displayed. The whole information received from the remote IdP is shown,
and can be dragged into expressions of the profile being created. After the profile is configured it must be saved
and can be assigned to the authenticator.

Besides the wizard it is also possible to perform a detailed testing of an already existing translation profile. 
This *dry run* feature is available from the same menu as the wizard and begins in the same way: with a sandboxed 
authentication. However, the last step is different: instead of an editor a detailed information on the profile's 
application to the data provided by remote IdP is presented, including even the relevant server's log.   


==== Reference
MVEL context reference:

. +idp+ Name of the IdP which provided the data 
. +attr+ Map indexed with attribute names. Value of each entry is a single value of the attribute. If the attribute
is multi-valued then the first value is returned. If the attribute has no value then empty string is returned. 
. +attrs+ Map indexed with attribute names. Value of each entry is a list of the attribute values.
. +id+ Value of the authenticated identity. If remote IdP returned multiple identities, then a random one is available,
though this is a very exotic case. 
. +idType+ The type of the identity stored in the +id+ variable.
. +idsByType+ Map of identity values indexed by type. Rarely useful.
. +groups+ List of all remote groups. 
 
Actions as +mapGroup+, +mapIdentity+ or +mapAttribute+ can be used with an expression returning either
a single value or a collection of values.

Example input profile:
------
1: Condition: true
Action: mapIdentity
Action parameters:
  unityIdentityType = userName
  expression = attr['urn:oid:2.5.4.3']
  credential requirement = Password requirement
  effect = CREATE_OR_MATCH

2: Condition: true
Action: mapAttribute
Action parameters:
  unityAttribute = cn
  group = /
  expression = attr['urn:oid:2.5.4.4']
  visibility = full
  effect = CREATE_OR_UPDATE

3: Condition: groups contains 'student'
Action: mapGroup
Action parameters:
  expression = '/A/B'
------

The above profile in the first action maps the attribute +urn:oid:2.5.4.3+ value to Unity identity of +userName+ 
type. Such identity will be created if doesn't exist, otherwise all other actions will be performed against 
the existing local identity with such userName. Subsequently the remote attribute +urn:oid:2.5.4.4+ value 
will be mapped to Unity attribute +cn+ and the attribute will be assigned in the root group if it doesn't exist.
If it does, its value will be updated (upon each login). Finally the user will be added to the '/A/B' group
assuming it is in the +student+ group as reported by the remote IdP.

==== Example expressions

The most often used condition:
----
true
----

Condition disabling the action:
----
false
----

Condition testing if a principal is a member of the +students+ group (which is a group at the remote IdP):  
----
groups contains 'students'
----  

Condition testing if a principal has the +cn+ attribute:
----
attr contains 'cn'
----

When writing expressions in actions, usually we need a string value. For instance here is the first value
of the _cn_ attribute:
----
attr['cn']
----

All values (list) of the same attribute:
----
attrs['cn']
----
  
It is also possible to glue many values. Let's create a DN, which can be used to dynamically create an identity:
----
'CN=' + attr['cn'] + ',O=' + attr['o'] + ',C=NO'
----


MVEL provides convenient operations on list of values too. The following expression converts a list of
groups (as returned by remote IdP, e.g. LDAP) to unity groups. A constant prefix +/it/groups/+ is added and 
3 initial characters are removed from the external group name, but only of the group name has at least 4 characters.

----
('/it/groups'+$.substring(3) in groups if $.length() > 3)
----  


Finally the value of the identity provided by remote IdP is available as follows:
----
id
----






=== Output translation

An output translation profile can be associated with an IdP-like endpoint as the SAML endpoints.
It can be used to filter the data being exposed (so called attribute release policies can be implemented
with output profiles). Also it can dynamically create additional data to be returned. It is even possible to
store the dynamically created data back into the local Unity database, so it becomes a regular data.

Configuration of output profiles is optional. If no profile is manually installed on an endpoint, then a so called
_default output profile_ is used. The default profile is simplistic: it doesn't filter anything and anly adds 
one additional attribute: +memberOf+ with all groups of the principal as value. 

Output translation profile operate on a data structure which is initially
filled by Unity with all attributes and identities of the queried principal. Attributes are from the group configured
in the endpoint.

MVEL context used in conditions and as value of some action parameters can use the following variables:

. +protocol+ Name of the protocol being used 
. +protocolSubtype+ Name of the protocol variant
. +requester+ Name of the requester
. +usedGroup+ Unity group from which attributes are served 
. +subGroups+ All sub groups of the Unity group from which attributes are served
. +attr+ Map indexed with principal's attribute names. Value of each entry is a single value of the attribute. 
If the attribute is multi-valued then the first value is returned. 
If the attribute has no value then empty string is returned. 
. +attrs+ Map indexed with attribute names. Value of each entry is a list of the attribute values.
. +idsByType+ Map of identity values indexed by type.
. +groups+ List of all groups the user is a member. 
. +authenticatedWith+ List of identities that were used to authenticate the user. 
If remote authentication was used the list contains a single identity that was used 
to map the remote user to the local entity (as chosen by the input translation profile). 
The list can have two elements when MFA was used.
. +idp+ Identifier of a remote IdP that was used to authenticate the current user's session. 
In case when only a local authentication was used, the value is set to +_LOCAL+.  
 

Example output profile:
------
1: Condition: idsByType contains 'userName'
Action: createAttribute
Action parameters:
  attributeName = userid
  expression = idsByType['userName']

2: Condition: true
Action: filterAttribute
Action parameters:
  unityAttribute = email
------

The above profile in the first action creates a new attribute +userid+ with a value of user's identity 
of the +userName+ type. The attribute is added only if the principal has such identity.
The second rule hides the email attribute unconditionally.

Additional examples of expressions and conditions can be found in the <<input-translation>> above. Note however
that only the variables from the output MVEL context can be used.
